# DSND-Project 1 - Write A Data Science Blog Post
This file is a documentation file for an exercise performed as a part of Data Scientist NanoDegree project 1 - Write a Data Science blog.

## Purpose and intent

Dataset is available here:https://www.kaggle.com/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction. Purpose of this excercise is to find answer to 3 questions (provide 3 insights):

Question 1 - How does the price changes with the age of the house?

Question 2 - How could the distance of the nearst MRT affect house pricing?

Question 3 -What is the role of nearby stores in house pricing?


## Prerequisites and Installation
You should have at least Python 3.x and some mathematical, statistical and visualization libraries in order to run this code in your local machine.
Here I used: 
- pip (for installing the required libraries)
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib


## Summary
Analysis has provded answer to 3 business questions and proven that (age of the houe, the distance to nearest MRT, number of convenience stores) 
and many other features have a big effect on house pricing.
